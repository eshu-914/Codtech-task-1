Description:-
The provided Java code implements a basic calculator program that takes user input for two numbers and the desired mathematical operation to perform. It utilizes a Scanner object to read user input from the console. The program prompts the user to enter the first and second numbers, followed by the desired operation, which can be addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), or exponentiation (^).

Following the input phase, the program evaluates the user's choice of operation using a series of if-else statements instead of a switch-case construct, as per the request. Each if-else block corresponds to one of the supported operations. If the entered operation matches one of the predefined cases, the program computes the result accordingly and displays it to the user. For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program performs the respective arithmetic operation directly using the provided numbers. However, for exponentiation, it utilizes the Math.pow() method to raise the first number to the power of the second number.

If the user enters an invalid operation that doesn't match any of the predefined cases, the program outputs a message indicating that an invalid operator was entered. This ensures that the program handles unexpected input gracefully and informs the user of any mistakes.

Overall, this calculator program provides a simple and interactive way for users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers of their choice. By utilizing if-else statements instead of a switch-case construct, it demonstrates an alternative approach to implementing the same functionality while maintaining clarity and readability.

Conclusion:-
The Java code provided constitutes a straightforward yet functional calculator program designed to perform arithmetic operations on two input numbers according to the user's choice of operation. The program begins by initializing a Scanner object to capture user input from the console. It then prompts the user to enter the first and second numbers, followed by the desired operation, which can be addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), or exponentiation (^).

Once the user input is obtained, the program evaluates the chosen operation using a series of if-else statements, avoiding the use of a switch-case construct as per the specified requirement. Each if-else block corresponds to one of the supported operations, facilitating clear and concise code organization. If the entered operation matches any of the predefined cases, the program computes the result accordingly and displays it to the user. For addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation directly using the provided numbers. However, for exponentiation, it leverages the Math.pow() method to calculate the result efficiently.

In cases where the user inputs an invalid operation that does not match any predefined case, the program handles this scenario gracefully by outputting a message indicating that an invalid operator was entered. This ensures user-friendly interaction and helps prevent unexpected program behavior due to erroneous input.

In conclusion, the provided code offers a simple yet effective solution for a basic calculator program, emphasizing readability, clarity, and user experience. While serving as a foundational example, the code's modular design and adherence to best practices lay the groundwork for potential future expansions, such as additional functionality or user interface improvements. Through its structured approach and logical organization, the code demonstrates a robust foundation for building upon and adapting to evolving requirements in software development.
